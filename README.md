# Treedex
<h3>What is this?</h3>
<hr>
<p><i>This</i> is a startpage for a web browser, personally I use it for Firefox. But it <i>should </i>work on all, if not <i>most</i> Web Browsers.<br>
You'll have to edit some of the code, such as the links to add your own shortcuts on the tree branches,<br>
but the rest is already pretty much set up for you.</p>
